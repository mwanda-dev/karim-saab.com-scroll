        slideTitle: "Threads of Tradition",
        slideDescription: "Stitch by stitch, the Symbolic binds flesh to narrative. Inheritances are not worn—they are embedded, tattooed through discourse. Fabric here is a skin: protective, constrictive, never yours.",
        slideURL: "/projects/heritage-weaves",
        slideTags: ["Culture", "Fashion", "Craft", "History"],
        slideImg: "slide-img-1.jpg"

    {
        slideTitle: "Stillness and Steel",
        slideDescription: "The void is structured like architecture. Steel is the mirror stage of modernity—cold, reflecting nothing. Stillness is not peace; it’s paralysis before the Real, where no signifier holds.",
        slideURL: "/projects/industrial-dream",
        slideTags: ["Architecture", "Minimal", "Contrast", "Space"],
        slideImg: "slide-img-2.jpg"

    {
        slideTitle: "Garden of Solitude",
        slideDescription: "A bloom without referent. Solitude becomes jouissance: excessive, unlivable. Nature simulates innocence, but the garden is a trap—Eden for the post-symbolic subject who knows paradise is foreclosure.",
        slideURL: "/projects/silent-bloom",
        slideTags: ["Nature", "Calm", "Botanical", "Escape"],
        slideImg: "slide-img-3.jpg"
    },
    {
        slideTitle: "Echoes in Indigo",
        slideDescription: "Steel reflections fracture the Imaginary; the city screams in silence. Every surface reflects the Other's desire. Indigo becomes the wound, the repetition compulsion, the absence masquerading as meaning.",
        slideURL: "/projects/urban-reverie",
        slideTags: ["Art", "City", "Reflections", "Modern"],
        slideImg: "slide-img-4.jpg"
    },
    {
        slideTitle: "Whispers of the Coast",
        slideDescription: "The gaze slips—oceanic, maternal, and void. The shore speaks what language cannot: desire displaced, identity drowned in tidal repetition. The coast is not a place—it is lack’s echo.",
        slideURL: "/projects/ocean-melody",
        slideTags: ["Nature", "Photography", "Travel", "Peace"],
